Data visualization of all available trending locations of the Twitter API using WebGL Globe

*NOTE: Because the access keys and tokens are covered in web.py, please replace these with your own keys and tokens retrieved from https://dev.twitter.com/index. To access a live version of this website, go to: http://trendsglobe.herokuapp.com/.

This web page displays a globe with all of the available trend locations provided by the Twitter API. This globe makes it easier to visualize which locations are currently available for accessing trend data.
This globe can also be used to see which locations are still not available for access, and this may be useful for developers to see which locations are still in need of trending data access.

A "Refresh" button was added to get the most updated list of locations, but because this button causes time out errors, this would need to be improved in the future to speed up the updating process.
